					<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>

					<p>The Flightforsale company was established in 2007 and is dedicated to finding discounted business and first class flight tickets. It operates within the jurisdiction of the United States and has a number of headquarters in the U.S., Eastern Europe and Cyprus and offers its services to customers globally.</p>

					<p class="grey">Flightforsale is not a seller and operates as an intermediary party in the purchase and sale of discounted business and first class tickets and frequent flyer miles. Supplementary services, such as the finding of desirable rates and route optimization, are free of cost. Repeat customers will be rewarded through our loyalty program which you can find out more about from your assigned agent. We do not offer hotel bookings or travel offers.  </p>

					<p class="grey">We do not provide discounted economy-class tickets or low-cost airway deals. We look exclusively for standard flights from the most respectable and well-established airlines. Saving on airplane tickets is easy, as you will discover by submitting a request via the website or by dialing our call-center.</p>

<h3>OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF THE PARTIES</h3>
